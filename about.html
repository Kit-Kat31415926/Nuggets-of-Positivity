            <p>Nuggets of Positivity was created to encourage <span style="color:gold">smiles</span> and <span style="color:gold">laughter</span>! 
                The mind is a deep ocean of thoughts, and oftentimes, people become 
                entrenched in negative thoughts and self-deprecation unknowingly. 
                This spiral into unhappiness spurred by the constant reminders of our 
                shortcomings is detrimental to our overall well-being. With Nuggets of 
                Positivity, people from all over are encouraged to share <span style="color:gold">quick, uplifting 
                    statements</span> to help <span style="color:gold">brighten a stranger's day</span>.
